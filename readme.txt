This program is designed to query the Universalis API for
finding the best item to buy from the Grand Company Quartermaster
to then sell on the market board.

As of 7-3-22, this program only looks up the values for 7 different items
that are available in the GCQ shop.
Keep in mind that the values generated are the most recent purchases of
those items and may not reflect true value of said item.






The EXE tool can be used without any configuration for Faerie.


Server IDs can be configured away from Faerie in the python only tool folder file.
You will need to install python and the requests module to use it.
